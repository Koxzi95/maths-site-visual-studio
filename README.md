maths-site-visual-studio
========================

A ASP.net website I created using visual studio 2012, for doing basic(ish) calc


I created this as a copy of a piece of work that I did at university for a C# module. The site makes use of the 3-layer architecture to complete 3 basic calculations from a array.
